# Transfer Reinforcement Learning
## About
(work in progress)

This project explores transfer learning in reinforcement models. Products using reinforcement learning are likely to go through many design iterations during their life cycle. Eventually these changes will invalidate previously trained policies. Through transfer learning the previously trained policy may be able to reduce the costs of retraining the model for the new product iteration.

This project uses the 2D walker environment available in the OpenAI gym, modified to accept the walker's leg length as an input parameter. Transfer learning demonstrated by training a policy for one walker, and then using that as the initial policy for a second walker of a different leg length.
